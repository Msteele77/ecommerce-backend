# E-commerce Back End

## Description:

This application is the back end of an ecommerce site which uses MYSQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect an Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

API Routes were created using RESTful CRUD Operations.

The routes were tested in Insomnia Core and can be viewed in the demo vidoes below.
